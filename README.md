# Summary of the Notebook
Data analysis: The notebook reads the data from two CSV files that contain the pre-intervention and post-intervention knowledge assessment scores of male and female participants on gender-based violence (GBV). It converts the categorical variables into numerical values and calculates the mean scores of each question for each group.

Statistical tests: The notebook performs a paired t-test for each question to test the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the pre-intervention and post-intervention scores. It also calculates the effect size (Cohenâ€™s d) for each question to measure the magnitude of the difference.

Results: The notebook displays the results of the t-test and the effect size in a table and interprets them. It also creates some bar plots to visualize the mean scores and the effect sizes of each question.
Conclusion: The notebook concludes that none of the questions showed a statistically significant difference between the pre-intervention and post-intervention scores, as all the p-values were greater than 0.05. However, some questions showed moderate to large effect sizes, suggesting that there may be some gender differences in the perception of GBV, but more data is needed to confirm this.
